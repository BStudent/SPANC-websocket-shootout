# C++ Benchmark Client

This tool implements a subset of the original websocket-bench tool. Its purpose is to determine if the original is skewing the results.

Highly modified from https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/blob/master/benchmarks/throughput.cpp to implement the same binary protocol as the Go benchmark does for broadcast. Original license: https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/blob/master/LICENSE
